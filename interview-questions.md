# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is object destructuring?

Your answer: to destroy a variable and make a new one.

Researched answer:The object destructuring is a useful JavaScript feature to extract properties from objects and bind them to variables.

2. What are React lifecycle methods? Provide three examples.

Your answer:

Researched answer:You can think of React lifecycle methods as the series of events that happen from the birth of a React component to its death. the three main examples are You can think of React lifecycle methods as the series of events that happen from the birth of a React component to its death.

Mounting – Birth of your component.
Update – Growth of your component.
Unmount – Death of your component.

3. What is the difference between a class and an object?

Your answer: a class is something that can be called an object something that gets introduced.

An object has a state in which all of its properties have values that you either explicitly define or that are defined by default settings.

4. What is the difference between a HTML div and a span?

5. What is a React Fragment (or <>) and why would you want to use it?

Your answer:to make a list of items stay together.

React fragments let you group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM because fragments are not rendered to the DOM. So basically we use React. Fragment where we would normally use a wrapper div.

6. What does it mean to create a responsive UI? What are three options for creating responsive design?

Your answer: it means that you can click and interact with the information on the page.

Researched answer:Responsive Web design is the approach that suggests that design and development should respond to the user’s behavior and environment based on screen size, platform and orientation. And the three main options are :
Fluid grids: Fluid grids are based upon the sizing of page elements as opposed to using pixels.
Media queries: Media queries allow the gathering of information about a site visitor.
Flexible images: The size of flexible images is dictated by relative units so they are kept inside of their element.

7. What are props in React?

Your answer: are calls for a set information to be plugged in

Researched answer:“Props” is a special keyword in React, which stands for properties and is being used for passing data from one component to another. But the important part here is that data with props are being passed in a uni-directional flow.

8. What is `this` in JavaScript?

Your answer: its a way to do string interpolation and show the variable that is called when put on a return.

Researched answer: when i researched this i got this. so not sure which one were talking either the this function on react or string interpolation

9. STRETCH: What is a ternary operator in JavaScript?

Your answer:its a function that allows you to switch in between players or emojis

Researched answer:The conditional (ternary) operator is the only JavaScript operator that takes three operands: a condition followed by a question mark ( ? ), then an expression to execute if the condition is truthy followed by a colon ( : ), and finally the expression to execute if the condition is falsy.

10. STRETCH: What is an anonymous function in JavaScript?

Your answer: it allows you to do or type things anonymously ???

Researched answer:An anonymous function is a function without a name. An anonymous function is often not accessible after its initial creation.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

- Ruby: Ruby is most used for building web applications. However, it is a general-purpose language similar to Python, so it has many other applications like data analysis, prototyping, and proof of concepts. Probably the most obvious implementation of Ruby is Rails web, the development framework built with Ruby.
- Object oriented programming:Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods).
- RSpec:Spec is a computer domain-specific language (DSL) (particular application domain) testing tool written in the programming language Ruby to test Ruby code. It is a behavior-driven development (BDD) framework which is extensively used in production applications.
- Instance variable:In object-oriented programming with classes, an instance variable is a variable defined in a class, for which each instantiated object of the class has a separate copy, or instance. An instance variable has similarities with a class variable, but is non-static.
- Ruby blocks:Ruby blocks are anonymous functions that can be passed into methods. Blocks are enclosed in a do-end statement or curly braces {}. do-end is usually used for blocks that span through multiple lines while {} is used for single line blocks. Blocks can have arguments which should be defined between two pipe | characters.
- Ruby hashes:A Hash is a collection of key-value pairs like this: "employee" = > "salary". It is similar to an Array, except that indexing is done via arbitrary keys of any object type, not an integer index.
  The order in which you traverse a hash by either key or value may seem arbitrary and will generally not be in the insertion order. If you attempt to access a hash with a key that does not exist, the method will return nil.
